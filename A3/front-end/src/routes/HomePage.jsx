                            For this project we had to choose between four different topics which were civil aviation, weather analysis, air quality and health and housing market. After discussions, we have chosen the housing market because our team lives in Melbourne, Australia where the price of houses have been very high and continue to rise so we consider this an important and timely topic for ourselves and users of our project.

                            This project will be conducted over twelve weeks and require the collection of Melbourne housing prices data along with their attributes such as their location and type of housing (Unit, House etc) which will then be trained by an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model in Python. FastAPI will be used in Python to create a backend connection to our frontend web application created in ReactJS to visualise the data so users can interact with an AI in a fun and effective way to keep them engaged.

                            For this project, we had to choose between four different topics: civil aviation, weather analysis, air quality and health, and the housing market. After discussions, we chose the housing market as our focus since we live in Melbourne, Australia, where house prices have been high and continue to rise. This is an important and timely topic for us and users of our project.

                            This project will be conducted over twelve weeks and requires the collection of Melbourne housing prices data along with attributes like location and type (e.g., Unit, House). The data will be used to train an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model in Python. Weâ€™ll connect the backend, built with FastAPI, to our React-based frontend web application to visualize data in a fun and engaging way.
